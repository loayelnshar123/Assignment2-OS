This document contains the code examples and explanations for Lab-5, along with answers to the assignment questions.

-------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Lab-5 Code Examples and Explanations
-------------------------------------------------

Exercise 1: Using fork() in C
------------------------------
Explanation:
• fork() splits the program into two processes.
• It returns 0 to the child process.
• It returns the child's Process ID (PID) to the parent process.
• The if/else if statements check the return value to make each process print a different message.


Exercise 2: Starting a Process in the Background
------------------------------------------------
Explanation:
• sleep 300: A command that does nothing for 300 seconds.
• &: The ampersand runs the command in the "background".
• jobs: Lists all commands running in the background from your terminal.


Exercise 3: Stopping a Process
-------------------------------
Explanation:
• ps aux | grep sleep: Finds the Process ID (PID) of the sleep command.
• kill <PID>: Sends a signal to stop the process with that specific PID. You replace <PID> with the actual number you found.


Exercise 4: Pausing and Resuming a Process
------------------------------------------
Explanation:
• kill -STOP <PID>: Pauses (freezes) the process. It's still alive but not running.
• kill -CONT <PID>: Continues (resumes) the paused process.


Exercise 5: Role of the Linker
------------------------------
Explanation:
• The linker takes the compiled code from file1.c and file2.c and connects them.
• It links the hello() call in file2.c to the hello() function definition in file1.c.


Exercise 6: Role of the Loader
------------------------------
Explanation:
• The loader is part of the OS that loads your program into memory when you run it.
• It also loads any necessary "shared libraries" (e.g., the library containing the printf function).


-------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Linker and Loader Job Explanations
-------------------------------------------------

Q: Explain what is the job of the Linker.
A: The compiler turns your .c files into .o files. The linker turns your .o files and libraries into one final executable program.


Q: Explain what is the job of the Loader.
A: The loader is a part of the operating system that loads a program from your hard drive into memory (RAM) so it can run.


-------------------------------------------------
Part 3: Makefile and Program Execution
-------------------------------------------------

• A Makefile was written to compile each of the examples efficiently.
• The command `make` was used from the project folder to build all the programs.
• Each compiled program was then run to verify its correct functionality and observe the concepts explained above.
